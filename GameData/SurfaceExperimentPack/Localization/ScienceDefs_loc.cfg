	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_KerbinSrfLanded = After reading the manual a few times, the command team is able to take an accurate reading.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_MunSrfLanded1 = The sensor conducts a detailed survey of the local gravity. Strange mass concentrations are found.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_MunSrfLanded2 = The interplay of Kerbin's gravity with the Mun's is gradually slowing Kerbin's rotation, while lifting the Mun's orbit.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_MinmusSrfLanded1 = The sensor takes detailed readings of the local gravity. It's wonky.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_MinmusSrfLanded2 = The Mun actually affects Minmus's orbit.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_EveSrfLanded = The gravity is very strong.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_GillySrfLanded = There are barely any readings to detect!
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_DunaSrfLanded = Assuming there once was water here, the tides caused by Ike were remarkably weak.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_DresSrfLanded = The sensor measures the local gravity. Passing asteroids affect it.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's proximity to Jool means that the entire surface undergoes tidal movement on a large scale.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_VallSrfLanded = Scanning on the surface allows you to make a rough map of the sub-surface water currents.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_TyloSrfLanded = Detailed scans have hinted to hollow spaces in the interior of the planet. You wonder what's down there.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_BopSrfLanded = There are some odd readings coming from the northwest crater.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_PolSrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for a highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol. There are strange mass concentrations all over the place.
	#LOC_SurfaceExperimentPack_sci_GravityScan_Exhaustive_EelooSrfLanded = Gravity scans are very clear here. There appears to be little influence from other bodies.
