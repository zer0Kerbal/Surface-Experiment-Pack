## Description

A long while ago, I created a mod called Munar Surface Experiment Pack, which was a decent mod, if I do say so myself. However, it was plagued with perpetual bugs, which, eventually, caused me to lose interest.

However, several weeks ago, the awesome CobaltWolf contacted me with the proposal that we collaborate on a remake of this mod. Naturally, I jumped at the chance.

Surface Experiment Pack is a much, much different mod than the old Munar Surface Experiment Pack, and much closer to the actual ALSEP experiments.
