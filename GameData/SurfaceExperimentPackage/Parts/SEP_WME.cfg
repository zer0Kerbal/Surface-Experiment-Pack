	description = This unique experiment was first designed by the Kerbal Weather Bureau to find out about the "wind gusts" that were blamed in many early rocket topple-off-the-pad failures. When those were revealed to be a conspiracy , it was sold to Jeb's Junkyard, who sold it to Integrated Integrals, who sold it to Albert Kermin Labs, who turned it into a wonderful new Surface Experiment Pack part for planets with atmospheres!  Caution- Does not run in vacuum.
